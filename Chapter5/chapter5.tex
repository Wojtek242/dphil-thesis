\section{Introduction}

In the previous chapter we have introduced a theoretical framework
which will allow us to study measurement backaction using
discontinuous quantum jumps and non-Hermitian evolution due to null
outcomes. We have also wrapped our quantum gas model in this quantum
trajectory formalism by considering ultracold bosons in an optical
lattice coupled to a cavity which collects and enhances light
scattered in one particular direction. One of the most important
conclusions of the previous chapter was that the introduction of
measurement introduces a new energy and time scale into the picture.

In this chapter, we investigate the effect of quantum measurement
backaction on the many-body state of atoms.
